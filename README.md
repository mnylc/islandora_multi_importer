### Why Use Multi-importer
* UI driven integrated workflow for ingest and update
* Metadata Cleanup: Export your MODS metadata as CSV via solr, clean up, then update the MODS datastream of the objects by recreating the MODS datastream using Twing
* To ingest different content types at the same time
* To avoid having to follow strict naming conventions and folder structure dictated by many Islandora batch ingest processes
* Selectively choose which derivatives you want to create and upload
* To avoid the OpenRefine/XSLT approach to creating MODS from CSVs
* To take advantage of the Twig Templating system for creating MODS from CSVs
* To preview the MODS output easily
* Supports integration with Google Spreadsheets, Zip/Local/Amazon storage
